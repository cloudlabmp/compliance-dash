Lab: Containerize Frontend Application
Objective
Containerize the compliance dashboard frontend application and expose it on port 3000.

Requirements:
1. Containerization
Create a Dockerfile in the /compliance-dash/frontend directory
Use Node.js 20.x as the base image
Set the working directory to /app
Copy package files and install dependencies
Copy the rest of the application code
Build the frontend application
Expose port 3000 in the container

2. Testing
Build the Docker image
Run a container from the image
Verify the application is accessible at http://localhost:3000

4. Deliverables
Dockerfile in the /compliance-dash/frontend directory
A brief README.md with build and run instructions

Success Criteria
The container builds successfully
The application is accessible on port 3000
The container runs in detached mode
The container can be stopped and removed cleanly

Hints
Use multi-stage builds to keep the final image small
Consider using .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files
Ensure the application is configured to listen on all interfaces (0.0.0.0)

Additional Notes
The solution should be production-ready
Include proper error handling and logging
Document any assumptions made during implementation
