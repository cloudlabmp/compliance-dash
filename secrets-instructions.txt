ðŸ—‚ Scenario
Your team is working to improve secret hygiene in Terraform-managed infrastructure. This lab focuses on securely storing secrets in AWS Secrets Manager and ensuring they are never exposed in plain text or persisted to Terraform state.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
âœ… Task 1: Securely store secrets in AWS Secrets Manager
Use Terraform to provision a new secret in AWS Secrets Manager. This secret will simulate sensitive data such as an API key or password.

âœ… Task 2: Do not persist secrets to state
Use Terraformâ€™s write-only attribute for secrets. This prevents Terraform from storing the secret value in the state file.

âœ… Task 3: Do not store secrets in plain text anywhere
Ensure your .tf files, .tfvars, and command-line usage do not contain raw secrets. Use environment variables, input variables, or external files outside of version control.

âœ… Completion Criteria
The secret is successfully created in AWS Secrets Manager.
No secret values appear in .tf or .tfstate files.
The Terraform config follows least-privilege and secure handling practices.
